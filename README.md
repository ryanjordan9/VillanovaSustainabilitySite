# VillanovaSustainabilitySite
Repository for the front-end of the sustainability database project headed by Jean Lutes. 

This website uses HTML & CSS for the UI. 
CSS is organized into a common file that holds styles common across multiple pages of the site, such as the appbar and more and then individual files for styles that are unique to a given page.
CSS follows the BEM naming convention. 

I chose to script with Javascript because it is taught in the Villanova Computer Science curriculum and therefore it is very likely future devlopers on this project will be experienced in it as well. 

The backend currently exists in the Computer Science Department's Oracle instance. 

The middleware in the project will use Node.js and its package `node-oracledb`. To install Node.js, follow these instructions: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. 
To install `node-oracledb`, open a terminal window in the project directory and type `npm install`. 
To see examples of how `node-oracledb` is used, follow this link: https://oracle.github.io/node-oracledb/doc/api.html#getstarted. 
To see how to install the software that `node-oracledb` depends on, follow this link: https://oracle.github.io/node-oracledb/INSTALL.html#quickstart.
