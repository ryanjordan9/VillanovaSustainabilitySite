# VillanovaSustainabilitySite
Repository for the front-end of the sustainability database project headed by Jean Lutes. 

This website uses HTML & CSS for the UI. 
CSS is organized into a common file that holds styles common across multiple pages of the site, such as the appbar and more and then individual files for styles that are unique to a given page.
CSS follows the BEM naming convention. 

I chose to script with Typescript because I have more experience with it and find that static typing is more reliable than dynamic typing. However, future scripts could conceivably be written in Javascript.
