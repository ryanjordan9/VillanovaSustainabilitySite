# VillanovaSustainabilitySite
Repository for the front-end of the sustainability database project headed by Jean Lutes. 

This website uses HTML & CSS for the UI. 
CSS is organized into a common file that holds styles common across multiple pages of the site, such as the appbar and more and then individual files for styles that are unique to a given page.
CSS follows the BEM naming convention. 

I chose to script with Javascript for the scripting because it is taught in the Villanova Computer Science curriculum and therefore it is very likely future devlopers on this project will  be experienced in it as well.
